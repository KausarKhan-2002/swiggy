1.CDN
2.Crossorigin

1. React.createElement will just create an HTML element inside React that is the core 
   react things.
2. But If we have to put the element into your DOM into our browser then we need to use 
   ReactDOM libraries.
   - We can just access the root element into ReactDOM using document and then render 
     inside DOM.
   - Because ultimately ReactDOM.createRoot will access the root from HTML and put it 
     inside ReactDOM.  
3.The most crucial things to the browsers is if suppose we have a web page and we click on the 
  any button then what we are showing something in DOM and what we are hiding something in DOM 
  means what we are getting changed immidiately that is the costly things to a broswer that'why 
  all the frameworks and libraries keep improving this things and in same way React improved 
  this things while providing our own DOM to track where the DOM is manuplating that is called 
  virtual DOM.

Create this structure using React.createElement.
<div id="parent">
    <div class="child">
        <h1>Heading</h1>
        <p>This is paragraph</p>
    </div>
</div>
