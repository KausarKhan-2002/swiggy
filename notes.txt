========================== EPISODE 1 ==================================
========================== Inception ==================================
Part 1 _____________________________
First way of adding react into our project via CDN
CDN => Content Deliver Network 
These are the website where React is hosted and we are just pulling 
React project from there.

Part 2 _____________________________
There are 2 types of CDN link for react available in CDN website 1st is for react and 
2nd is for reactDOM so we can just put this links in our normal html file and start 
working like a React.
<script
  crossorigin
  src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
  ></script>
<script
  crossorigin
  src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
></script>

Part 3 _____________________________
React.createElement take 3 arguments 1st is element 2nd is attribute in form of object and 
3rd is content of element.

React.createElement is just as an object.
const heading = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello world from React!')
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.querySelector('#root'))
    root.render(heading)
console.log(heading) object

render() is responsible to take this object and convert it into element and put it 
into the DOM.

Part 4 _____________________________
Nested of element is possible
Sibling is possible

Note: If we write anything direct inside root then all that things will be replaced by 
      createRoot.

========================== EPISODE 2 ==================================
====================== Igniting our app ===============================
Part 1 ___________________________________ 
NPM: To include any packages in our project we need to use NPM.
     All the packages are hosted in NPM.
    
    NPM does stand for node package manager it is a manager for everything that'why 
    there are alot of random name available inside it's github repository but it works 
    for package manager but not stand for the package manager.

By following all these command we will get package.json file that is configuration to the npm.
Suppose If we are using any library or package so npm take care of what is the version of 
that library or package inside package.json file.

package.json is a configuration to the npm that means If we install any package library 
anything by npm then all that things will be configured inside package.json file.
It can be Github configuration, It can be BrowserList configuration or anything else.
